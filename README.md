## Installation

This script runs with Python 3.8 and newer.

You can install dRPG from PyPI:
```bash
pip install --user drpg
drpg --help  # or python -m drpg --help
```

## Usage

1. Go to [your account settings](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/account_edit.php)
   and generate a new application key.
2. Copy the key and run the script: `drpg --token <YOUR_DRPG_TOKEN>` - or set
   `DRPG_TOKEN` env variable and run `drpg`.
3. Now just sit, relax and wait. Initial synchronization may take a while so
   why don't you grab a cup of tea or whatever your favourite beverage is. On
   consecutive runs the script will download only new and changed files which
   will be a way faster.

## Compatibility

Because of the nature of using an undocumented API, this software may break
without a notice. Version number indicates a year and a month when the software
was proved to be working with a real DriveThruRPG account.

### Advanced options

You can change where your files will be downloaded by using `--library-path
path/to/your/directory`.

By default the script does not compare files by md5 checksum to save time. You
can turn it on by using `--use-checksums`.

You can change a log level by using `--log-level=<YOUR_LOG_LEVEL>`. Choices are
DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.

You can do a "dry run" of the app by specifying `--dry-run`. This will determine
all the digital content you have purchased, but instead of downloading each file
it will print one line of information to show what file *would* have been downloaded
if the `--dry-run` flag wasn't on. Use this if you want to test out the app without
taking the time to download anything.

For more information, run the script with `--help`.
